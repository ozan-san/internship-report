\section{Project}
The project I have completed is called JFM Overseer. Overseer is an application written in Python 3.7, preferably for use with Anaconda distributions, and is capable of predicting time series. The overall structure of the application is as in the following diagram: \\
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|ll} 
\cline{1-1}\cline{3-3}
GUI components (PyQT5) & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$\rightarrow$} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{Matplotlib}  \\ 
\cline{1-1}\cline{3-3}
Facebook Prophet \& StatsModels  &                         &                        \\ 
\cline{1-1}
Pandas  &                         &                        \\ 
\cline{1-1}
Time Series Data (.csv)  &                         &                        \\
\cline{1-1}
\end{tabular}
\end{table} \\
The components and how to set them up are as follows:
\subsection{Time Series Data Specifications}
Overseer is a tool to analyze Time Series data, which must be given to the program as .csv files, with the following structure: \\

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
$ds$    & $y$    \\
$t_0$  & $y_0$  \\
\vdots & \vdots
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
In this representation, $t$ must correspond to a date-time value, mainly, parse-able by Matplotlib and other software used. The values for y must be integers. \\
This lets us create a function $F(t) = y$, which is useful in upcoming definitions.
My goal was mainly to produce a prediction, namely, we have to define values $m_t, n_t$ such that for any $t > t_{end}$, where the last observed point of the function F is at time $t_0 + end$, the equation
\begin{equation*}
	P(m_{t} < F(t) < n_{t}) = 0.95
\end{equation*}

must hold. This corresponds to creating a $95\%$ probability interval for the possible observed values of the function $F$ in the future, and means that we have made a prediction. The values $m_t$ and $n_t$ can be averaged to yield a possible future value of $F$. The process for doing this was explained in (Box and Wilkins CITE). However, before getting to that, we must first process the data. 

\subsection{Pandas}
Pandas is a tool to analyze spreadsheets, and process them in Python, dubbed ``Excel for Python". It has capabilities in displaying, analyzing, converting and processing data.
\subsubsection{How To Install}
In a shell, execute:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
pip install pandas
\end{lstlisting}
... or, in an Anaconda environment, use:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
conda install pandas
\end{lstlisting}
to install Pandas to your preferred Python environment. Using Anaconda distributions is recommended for resolving dependency problems, as nearly all of the packages used in the project are already included in Anaconda distributions.
\subsubsection{Usage}
An example code snippet from the project is as such:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(data.csv)
\end{lstlisting}
This loads the .csv file into memory, and is modified to suit our needs as such (will be further explained in (XREF FBPROPHET)):
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
#'COL1' denoting the first column's name
# in the .csv file, this was primarily
# called 'Category' in my company's query results.
df['COL1'] = df['COL1'].apply(pd.to_datetime)
dataframe.columns = ['ds', 'y']
\end{lstlisting}
After doing this, we can work further on the data.
