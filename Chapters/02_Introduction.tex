% Introduction

I have completed my internship at JotForm Yazılım A.Ş., R\&D office, at Hacettepe Teknokent, Ankara. \\
My internship was about Time Series Analysis (TSA), and an implementation of a prediction system,
using metrics provided by JotForm. The metrics are numerical, and represents the state (mainly, financial state)
of the company. Using SARIMAX modelling, I have made a system which makes predictions about the future,
and, when in need, can be exported as a graph, and be further evaluated by the Data Science team of JotForm. This
will be further explained in further sections of this document.
